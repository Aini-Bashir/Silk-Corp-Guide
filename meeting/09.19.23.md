# EOD report
## Happy Tuesday

- The whole SILK Team had a backlog grooming meeting for about an hour to update our milestones, issues, review PRs, and get them approved.
- I created two new issues. First one, issue# 288, the competition analysis table, and second issue# 289, competitive advantages for the guide.
- I got acces to Envato elements, downloaded the requested images on the issues for the team, and saved them in the images folder.
- I created three pull requests issue# 283, [Balance sheet](https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/292), issue# 288, [competition analysis table](https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/292), and [impact to the US economy](https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/290).
