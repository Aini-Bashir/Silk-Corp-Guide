**Societal Impact **

In summary, the SILK LIFE program's YAC.H.T. activities, underpinned by the S.I.L.K. values, create a dynamic and transformative experience that prepares women to be leaders and changemakers. These women become the threads that hold the fabric of society together, promoting a world that is diverse, interconnected, and enriched by the contributions of all its members. They are not just participants in the global market or members of their local communities; they are the weavers of a future that values strength, integrity, love, and knowledge above all.
