- I had a meeting with the new members for an hour and introduce them with the SILK Project and basic rules and regulations on how to do SMART STAR and communication.
- I reviewed PRs of my team and communicate with them on GitHub.
- I updated the description of all our milestones and added the purpose of each milestone.
- Did some research on how to create a document for the SILK AMbassador program and about their standards.
