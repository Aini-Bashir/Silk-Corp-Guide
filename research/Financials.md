## Break-Even Analysis:

- Fixed costs are expenses that do not change with the level of output or sales. For SILK Corp, these might include rent for the premises, salaries for permanent

staff, and depreciation of equipment used for yoga classes, crafts, homesteading services, café and hospitality business, and tech jobs.

- Variable costs, on the other hand, fluctuate with the level of output or sales. These might include the cost of materials for crafts and homesteading services, food

and beverages for the café, and wages for part-time or freelance tech professionals.

- Revenue for SILK Corp would come from the fees charged for yoga classes, sales of crafts and homesteading products, income from the café and hospitality business,

and earnings from tech jobs. Each of these revenue streams might have different pricing structures and demand levels, which need to be factored into the break-even

analysis.
