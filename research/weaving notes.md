### What is Weaving?
Weaving is the process of interlacing vertical and horizontal threads at right angles to create a textile. People around the world have practiced weaving for thousands of years, and they use it to create many kinds of fabrics. By varying the way threads are woven, different surface appearances are created. As with any specialized activity, there are words related to the weaving process and equipment.


### Basic Weave Terminology

Warp - The warp thread functions as the skeleton of your weave and holds the tension while you are weaving.
### weaving terms that you should know to get started!It is normally strung vertically over the loom.
### Warp
The namesake of this blog! More commonly known as the vertical yarn in a weaving that accounts for the overall structure. Warp yarns are strong and able to withstand the tension from your floor or frame loom.
### Weft
The horizontal threads that are passed over and under the foundation warp threads. A good way to remember this is that Weft Goes Left. I mean it also goes right… but that doesn’t rhyme. You get the picture. Weft can be anything from yarn to fabric to grass. Pretty much anything can be weft. Inspiring.
### EPI
Ends Per Inch. This refers to the number of warps that reside in every inch of your weaving. This will determine the spacing of the warps. Warp spacing is incredibly import ant because it determines the kind of weaving you are making. A larger EPI will usually result in a more balanced weave. A smaller EPI will usually result in a weft-faced weave. As in life – there are exceptions and it’s a bit more complicated than that, but that’s your general rule
### Plain Weave (Tabby)
Weave structure in which the weft passes over, then under consecutive warps. Think of it as over one warp and under the next. Repeat, repeat, repeat. A lot of types of weavings fit into this description – including balanced weave and tapestry.
