# EOD file

- Had a meeting with the SILK team on improving the synopsis by reducing the length of the synopsis to make it clear and readable.
- The synopsis should be into phases and concise and also need to create a mermaid file on it.
- Had a meeting on the Getaway party and browsed flyers and brochures for party. Team gathered and presented with some ideas from the Canva but didn't finalize one yet.
- The team member created a PR on [updating the synopsis](https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/330) and I reviewed and commented on the document.
- Had a meeting with the TPM managers on improving the leading way to th eteam. Updating with feedbacks, suggestions, and reviews after the meetings so we have a proof that what we discussed in the meetings.
