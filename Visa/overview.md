# Welcome to the SILK Life Training Program

The [Tao Learning Institute](https://taolearning.org), in collaboration with [SILK Corp](https://silkcorp.org), is thrilled to announce the call for applications for the SILK Life Training Program. This pioneering 2-year program, conceived by the visionary Mr. Hackney, is not just an educational journey but a transformative experience designed to redefine the landscape of product management across a spectrum of industries. Through this program, participants will be prepared to lead and innovate in various product domains, including software, properties, services, and more, utilizing our proprietary SILK Life Method.

### About the Program

The SILK Life Training Program is a testament to Mr. Hackney's diverse background as a professional ballroom dancer, an award-winning creative director, a product developer, and the owner of multiple 5-Star boutique getaways worldwide. His achievements, spanning Silicon Valley to the creative arts, including his tenure at Disney & ABC, have inspired the creation of this program to nurture the next generation of product managers and champions. His development of nationally recognized fitness programs such as [Airikai](https://airikai.com), which reached millions globally, showcases his innovative approach to product development and management.

This program is the only one of its kind, with an emphasis on building powerful personas. This includes creating personas for brands, individuals, or artificial intelligence. A significant part of our product management curriculum and the SILK ethos revolves around our ability to encapsulate and expand personas. This ensures we can quantify and create a very targeted demographic for any program or product we are involved in. With the rising trend of AI in the market and our over 20 years of experience in building AI personas, our program stands out. It is ideal for individuals with degrees in communication, psychology, business, or those seeking a master's-level program to not only learn high-end product management skills but also master the art of building compelling personas.

Participants will become experts in AI persona creation, branding persona creation, and similar fields. This includes developing powerful backstories and prompt engineering techniques, ensuring our AI personas are remarkably human-like. The SILK trainees will emerge as leaders in creating personas that resonate deeply, holding together a brand or idea with clarity and impact.
