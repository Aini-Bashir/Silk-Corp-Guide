## **Contribution Guide**
A general overview of how to contribute is found in https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide .

Everytime your pull requests when working directly on the .html file are merged, it shows in the website https://guide.silkcorp.org/.

If you're not comfortable working directly on the .html side of this Guide, then let's work together through the [research markdown](https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/tree/gh-pages/research) files. Keep in mind in doing the following,

1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/issues) or [Milestones](https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/milestones).
   - Most issues are found in this area. Comment on the issue if you are working on it. 
2. Follow the same number of character count used in the template guide.
3. Create your markdown files in the [research folder](https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/tree/gh-pages/research).
4. Attach your markdown file to the issue you're working on by commenting.
   - This will help the Admins or others check out your markdown files.
5. Ask Marisa or Zee if you're a part of our SILK Corp Teams Chat.
