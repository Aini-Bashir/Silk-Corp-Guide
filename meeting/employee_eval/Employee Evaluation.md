## 07-01-23 to 07-31-23
- How many hours total did she work?

She took many off during July because of natural disaster in her country. She is a full time employee with us but she worked many days for 4 hours only
becuase of unstable internet issues. I don't have MS shifts sheet access to gave proper statistical report of how many hours she actually worked.

- How many contributions?

Total 50 contribution in the whole month on GitHub.

- How her performance was overall for July?How many days did she skip / work?

According to contributions on GitHub, she worked 13 days.

- How her performance was overall for July?

She is working slow, most of days only focused on working on requested changes on PRs. We spent approximately 30-40 minutes only
on trainings. She is trying hard I believe so, but her performance is not that much satisfactory. 

- Are you happy with the outcome & any recommendations to me / April for better productivity?

Her outcome is not that much satisfacoty yet but she is trying hard to make her capable for this company. We've decided to gave her another chnace becuase
at the start she wansn't very much familiar with GitHub and now she have gained much knowledge to contribute more to the project. Also, she needs to resolve
the internet problems and all the blockers she is facing.  

- What actions do you have planned for August?

We are almost at the end of completing website and plans of backlog grooming meetings for the project. Meanwhile for April, we've planned to gave her a chance
for this month (August) for observation and if she grows with her collaboration, communication, and working skills and deserves the pay she get.
While looking for people to add in SILK group.
