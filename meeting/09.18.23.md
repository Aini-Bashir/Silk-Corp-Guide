# Today's EOD report
- I created a new issue on creating a draft for the table of content 2.0 version.
- I created a PR on the [TOC 2.0 version](https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/287).
- The whole SILK Team had a meeting for 15 minutes where I showed the templates layouts and asked for their suggestions. The whole team gave some suggestions to add new things there and commented as well on my Pull request to share their ideas.
- I completed creating [lo-fi templates](https://github.com/NoteHive/Silk-Corp-Guide/pull/285) on the Figma for the SILK culture fusion program and created a PR on it.
