#### Examples of What to Include in Your SILK Matrix:

- **Strength (Yoga):** A photo of you in a challenging yoga pose, demonstrating physical or mental resilience, accompanied by a description of how this practice enhances your strength.

- **Integrity (Tech):** An example of a technology solution you've created that addresses a social or ethical issue. Explain the integrity behind the project's conception and its impact.

Your SILK Matrix is more than just a collection of photos; it's a narrative of how you embody the SILK virtues through the Y.A.C.H.T. components. Each entry should be a testament to your adaptiveness, creativity, and commitment to the SILK Life values.
