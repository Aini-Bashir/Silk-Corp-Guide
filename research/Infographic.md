Create a side view flat cartoon style 2D infographic of a yacht. The yacht should be split into five distinct sections labeled Y, A, C, H, T. The 'Y' section represents the bow of the yacht, and the 'T' section represents the stern. Each section should be visually distinct and color-coded to represent different themes associated with the SILK YACHT program: 

Y (Yoga): Illustrate this section with calming colors and symbols like a yoga mat or a person in a meditative pose. 

A (Arts): Use vibrant colors and artistic symbols like a paintbrush, dance shoes, or musical notes. 

C (Caf√©): Design this section with warm, inviting colors and include imagery like a coffee cup, a plate of food, or a chef's hat. 

H (Home): Choose cozy and welcoming colors, and depict symbols of home like a bed or a lamp. 

T (Tech): Use modern, sleek colors and include tech symbols like a computer, gears, or a network icon. 

 

Ensure the infographic is clear, engaging, and easily understandable, with a playful and educational tone suitable for a wide audience.
