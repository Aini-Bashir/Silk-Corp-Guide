|---|---|
| warp | The threads running lengthwise on a loom, forming the foundation of the fabric. |
| weft | The threads running crosswise on a loom, interlaced with the warp to create the fabric. |
| shed | The space between raised warp threads where the weft is passed through. |
| beater | A tool used to compact the weft threads against the previous row, creating a dense fabric. |
| shuttle | A tool used to carry the weft thread across the loom. |
| pick | One pass of the weft thread through the shed. |
| selvage | The strong edges of a woven fabric created by turning back the warp threads. |
| webbing | A narrow fabric usually using two ply yarns. Typically used for upholstery, luggage, conveyor belts and seat belts. See narrow fabrics. |
| Weave | The term weave is used normally to describe the structure of a woven fabric or the process of weaving which is usually carried out on a loom. Woven fabrics are constructed with two sets of interlacing warp and weft yarns. The warp yarns, or ends, are usually wound lengthwise on the loom, while the weft yarns, or picks, interlace the warp at right angles to produce the fabric. |
| Union | A fabric made with the warp yarn of one fibre differing from the weft yarn of another fibre. For example it is common to find tea towels made with linen warps and cotton wefts. |
| Twisting | In the case of yarns which are spun by intermittent methods, for example the drop spindle, spinning wheel or Indian charkha, the twist is inserted into the yarn by rotation of the spindle, one turn of the spindle per one turn of twist in the yarn. |
| Tapestry | A handwoven picture using a ribbed plain weave structure. The warp is traditionally of wool, cotton or linen. The weft, which is used to form the picture and covers the warp, is traditionally of wool. |
| Spinning | The process by which a mass of staple fibres is converted into a yarn or thread to meet required specifications of thickness, evenness, twist and composition. |
| Shot SILK | An iridescent effect in a silk cloth, like taffeta, woven with one colour in the warp and contrasting colour in the weft.|
| Shed | The opening for the weft to pass through selected lifted warp ends leaving the remainder lowered. For instance when weaving a plain weave fabric, the warp ends are lifted and lowered alternately. |
| Raw SILK | Continuous filaments of silk, with no twist, which have been reeled from cocoons but as yet, unprocessed and still containing sericin. |
