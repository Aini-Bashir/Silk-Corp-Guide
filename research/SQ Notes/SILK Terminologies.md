| Warp & Weft | Introduce how your program's online framework and individual journeys work together. |
| Reed | Depict this as a tool for self-evaluation and ensuring balance and consistency in your practices. |
| shed | The space between raised warp threads where the weft is passed through. |
| shuttle | A tool used to carry the weft thread across the loom. |
| selvage | The strong edges of a woven fabric created by turning back the warp threads. |
| webbing | A narrow fabric usually using two ply yarns. Typically used for upholstery, luggage, conveyor belts and seat belts. See narrow fabrics. |
| Weave | The term weave is used normally to describe the structure of a woven fabric or the process of weaving which is usually carried out on a loom. Woven fabrics are constructed with two sets of interlacing warp and weft yarns. The warp yarns, or ends, are usually wound lengthwise on the loom, while the weft yarns, or picks, interlace the warp at right angles to produce the fabric. |
| Union | A fabric made with the warp yarn of one fibre differing from the weft yarn of another fibre. For example it is common to find tea towels made with linen warps and cotton wefts. |
| Twisting | In the case of yarns which are spun by intermittent methods, for example the drop spindle, spinning wheel or Indian charkha, the twist is inserted into the yarn by rotation of the spindle, one turn of the spindle per one turn of twist in the yarn. |
| Scouring | Depict clearing away distractions and clutter to create space for growth and renewal. |
| Spinning | The process by which a mass of staple fibres is converted into a yarn or thread to meet required specifications of thickness, evenness, twist and composition. |
| Carding | Describe how self-reflection and introspective activities "card" out impurities and refine strengths.|
| Shed | The opening for the weft to pass through selected lifted warp ends leaving the remainder lowered. For instance when weaving a plain weave fabric, the warp ends are lifted and lowered alternately. |
