To conduct comprehensive research on weaving and tapestry terminology for the SILK LIFE program's Cultural Exchange initiative, you can follow this structured process:

### Step 1: Define Objectives
Before starting your research, clearly define what you want to achieve. In this case, it is to understand weaving-related terms that can be used metaphorically within the SILK LIFE program to enrich its cultural exchange component.

### Step 2: Gather Basic Information
Start with basic concepts before diving into more complex ones:
- **Weaving**: Understand the fundamental process of weaving—how threads or yarns are interlaced to form cloth.
- **Tapestry**: Learn about tapestry as an art form and how it differs from other types of textile arts.

### Step 3: Compile a List of Keywords
Create a list of initial keywords such as "weaving," "tapestry," "looms," "silk production,"  "spinning," "strands," "fiber,"etc. Expand this list by including:
- Types of weaves (plain weave, twill, satin)
- Parts of a loom (heddle, shuttle, reed)
- Weaving techniques (ikat, jacquard)
- Cultural weaving styles (kilim rugs, Japanese silk)

### Step 4: Conduct Research
Utilize multiple sources for diverse perspectives:
- **Books & Ebooks**: Look for books specifically on textiles and cultural histories of weaving.
- **Academic Journals**: Search databases like JSTOR or Google Scholar for scholarly articles.
- **Online Forums & Communities**: Engage with textile enthusiast communities online.
  
When researching each term or concept:
1. Note down its definition.
2. Record how it fits into the broader context of textile arts.
3. Identify any cultural significance or historical relevance.

### Step 5: Organize Findings
As you gather information:
1. Create a document organized by categories (e.g., Terms Related to Looms).
2. Write down definitions in your own words where possible; otherwise quote and reference properly.

### Step 6: Analyze Relevance 
Review all collected data and analyze which terms could metaphorically align with SILK LIFE values and Y.A.C.H.T pillars.

For example,
**Loom** - Represents framework; akin to personal development structure in Yoga pillar.
**Interlacing Threads** - Symbolizes integration; comparable to community connections in Café pillar.

### Step 7: Validate Information 
Ensure accuracy by cross-referencing facts across different reputable sources.

### Step 8: Prepare Documentation 
Compile your findings into an accessible format such as a glossary or annotated bibliography that staff members can refer to easily.

Remember also that some terms might have different meanings in various cultures so note these nuances where applicable – they will be valuable during cultural exchanges within the program.

By following these steps systematically, you'll create a rich resource that not only educates but also inspires those involved in implementing and participating in the SILK LIFE program’s initiatives.

picking or using a carding machine straightens and lines up the fibers for the spinning machine
Then you got a roving

Spinning
Listen to a beat when spinning
from big fluffy bat
When adding bat just add to the pinch to allow the same amount to go through using the left hand to find the orifice of the spinning wheel while the right hand uses pulling back the roving to get the same size
Learn the beat with the slowest speed

Notes from Cocoons to SILK in Vietnam:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBz40ZxKJBs

Worms form cocoons
Worms are hard to raise, need the perfect environment, temperature of 22 degrees C, food
Silkworms eat mulberry leaves
worms are raised on bamboo mats
Good worms will climb up the leaves at the top of a plastic sheet with holes while the bad ones just fall down
Worms has spinneret mouth to produce the cocoon 
when they built their cocoon after a few days boil them and separate the silk from the worms.
Silk is pulled from the cocoon
Then they are dried from a spinner, continuously reeling, and needs to be reeled the right way or it will snap when woven
Threads are woven and dyed with natural dyes
Noble choice of fabric
Vietnam silk is made since Bronze Ages

Worm spit
Eggs to larvae 14 days
Eat mulberry leaves 42 days before cocoon
