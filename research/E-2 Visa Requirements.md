# E-2 visa investment requirements:

### 1. What are all the various ways someone can have an Investment in E-2?
- Investing cash into a new or existing U.S. business. This is the most common type of E-2 investment. 
- Purchasing equipment to be used by the business. This could include machinery, tools, fixtures, etc.
- Purchasing business inventory that will be sold by the E-2 business. The inventory must be substantial.
- Investing in the improvement of land/buildings owned or leased by the business. Real estate investments generally do not qualify on their own for E-2.
- Acquiring patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property to be used by the E-2 business. 
- Licensing proprietary technology, processes, trade secrets, or other intangible property to the U.S. business. 
- Investing into an existing U.S. business either through a partial or full acquisition. Merely buying publicly traded stock does not qualify.
- Joint venturing via a 50-50 partnership with a U.S. partner to create a new commercial enterprise. 
- Purchasing a franchise and being an active franchisee manager. Passive investment as a silent partner does not qualify.

The key requirements are that the investment is substantial, at-risk, more than marginal, and generates significantly more income than just for the
investor's salary. The source of funds must also be fully documented and legally acquired.

### 2. Can it be a scholarship program from a franchise?
No, a scholarship program from a franchise would likely not qualify as a valid investment for the E-2 visa. Here's why:
- The E-2 investment must be made by the visa applicant using their own funds, not funds provided by another entity like the franchisor. 
- Scholarship funds are generally provided at no cost to the recipient, so there is no real "investment" being made by the applicant themselves.

### 3. Can you get a Franchise & own 50% of it, but the other 50% owner gifts you the funds for your 50%?

- If a franchisee receives gifted funds from the franchisor for 50% ownership of a franchise, this would likely not meet the E-2 investment requirements.
The funds need to be invested by and at risk for the potential E-2 visa holder themselves.
- Gifted funds generally do not place the recipient's money sufficiently at risk since they did not provide the capital.

### 4. Can the Franchise give a loan to the franchisee for 50% ownership and use that?
- A franchise cannot simply provide a loan for 50% ownership to a potential E-2 investor. The funds need to be invested by and at risk for the E-2
applicant. Loans from the franchisor would not qualify.

### 5. Can a lease on a building and a 5-year lease contract qualify as an investment?
Yes, leasing a commercial property and having a long-term lease could potentially qualify as a valid investment for the E-2 visa, provided certain requirements are met:
- The leased property will be used for operating the treaty-qualifying E-2 business (cannot just be held for passive income).
- The lease term is sufficiently long - typically 3-5 years or more would be considered substantial.
- The value of the lease is significant and not marginal - this includes the total rent paid over the full lease term.
- Renovations, improvements, fixtures being installed can help meet the investment threshold.
- The lease contract and payments must be documented and conducted at fair market value rates.
- The lease must be an arm's length transaction, not leased from a related or affiliated entity.
- Prepaid rent and security deposits can be counted toward the investment amount.
- Mere short-term leases or marginal rental amounts would not qualify.

### 6. Can the main Franchise pay for this lease on behalf of the Franchisee?
No, the E-2 visa investment requirements would likely not be met if the main franchisor pays for the lease instead of the franchisee investor:
- The E-2 investor must place their own funds at risk - paying the lease from their own resources. Funds from the franchisor would not qualify.
- Even if used for the business, the lease investment must come directly from the E-2 visa applicant. A lease paid by the franchisor would not meet this requirement.
- There is insufficient risk to the E-2 investor's funds if the franchisor is paying the lease instead. The applicant has not committed their own resources.
- The source of funds must clearly be from and documented for the E-2 investor. A lease paid by the franchisor raises source of funds issues.
- The franchisor paying the lease could be viewed as incurring the business expenses on behalf of the franchisee, rather than the required investment of funds.
- The franchisee may not have sufficient equity at risk in the business if core expenses like the lease are funded by the franchisor rather than the E-2 investor.

In summary, the E-2 investment funds need to be invested by and placed at risk by the visa applicant themselves, not loans or gifts provided by the 
franchisor. Investments need to be more than marginal and meet all regulatory requirements to qualify for E-2 status.
### 7. If the franchise is split 50/50 and the franchise gets a 5-year lease for $200,000 from a property management firm for a B&B with a cafe inside it, will this be sufficient for both franchisee owners who are both foreigners from qualifying e-2 countries to qualify for an E-2 visa?
In this scenario, the property management firm will have in their agreement that the lessee can pay off the lease through property improvements to the leased property and other properties managed by the property management firm and services offered to the property management firm up to $80,000 in value for the first 2 years, whereby the following 3 years need at least 50% cash payment for the lease. This is in the spirit of helping entrepreneurship and helping incubate the startup business.
The remaining 50% may be paid through continued property improvements that will be itemized and defined within the lease.
Does this situation qualify 2 applicants for E-2 Visas?
- To qualify for an E-2 visa, the business must have sufficient capital invested. Paying a large portion of the lease through services rather than cash may not meet this requirement, especially since the services are not precisely defined upfront.
- The business needs to generate significantly more income than just supporting the investors. A 50/50 split of $200,000 per year may not be considered substantial, ongoing income for two investors.
- The E-2 requires the business to be more than just marginal. The flexibility on lease payments and incubator-style arrangement could give the impression this is more of a small startup rather than an established business operation.
- Real, at-risk capital needs to be invested by both individuals seeking E-2 status. If a significant portion of the lease is covered through unspecified services, it may not be seen as a substantial cash investment.

  Overall, for the E-2 visa, the business needs to demonstrate substantial capital investment, significant revenue generation, and ongoing operations to support more than just the owners. While creative arrangements can help startups, immigration officials may determine this particular scenario does not sufficiently establish a strong, active business eligible for the E-2 program. Consultation with an immigration attorney is highly recommended to evaluate if additional factors or documentation could strengthen the case.

### 7. What if Jane is working for XYZ Pvt Ltd in the Philippines... then XYZ Inc. Headquarters invites Janes to Korea for 1 month of training and then to the USA for a continued Franchisee training program for 6 months.

Jane arrives in the USA on a B1/2 visa and conducts her training over a 6-month period while still working remotely for XYZ Pvt Ltd.

Jane then goes to Canada for 5 months and continues working remotely for XYZ Pvt Ltd. While in Canada, Jane applies for an L-1 Management visa sponsorship provided by XYZ Inc.
Would this work arrangement qualify for Jane?

- The initial B1/B2 visa to enter the US for training would likely not count towards the 1 continuous year of employment abroad required for an L-1. Training generally does not qualify as a proper employment arrangement.
- Working remotely for the foreign entity XYZ Pvt Ltd while physically in the US could be an issue. To maintain valid status, B1/B2 visitors typically cannot engage in remote work while present in the US. This calls into question whether Jane was properly maintaining status.
- There may be concerns that Jane's ultimate intent was to stay and work in the US all along rather than just temporary training, which would be inconsistent with the terms of a B1/B2 visa.
- Spending 5 months in Canada before applying for the L-1 could also raise questions on whether the 1 year of foreign employment was truly continuous. Short trips generally can be counted, but 5 months may be considered an interruption.

Overall, while creative arrangements are sometimes used, immigration officials could see Jane's path as an attempt to circumvent the normal L-1 visa requirements, rather than a legitimate foreign work assignment. Especially problematic is the long-term US stay for "training" on a B1/B2 visa while still remotely working abroad. To improve the chances of success, it would be advisable to consult with an immigration attorney to determine if additional documentation or qualifications could help overcome some of these potential concerns regarding continuous employment abroad and proper visa status.
