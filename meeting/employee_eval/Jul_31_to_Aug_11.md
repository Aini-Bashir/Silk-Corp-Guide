[AprilSamson]([url](https://github.com/AprilSamson)https://github.com/AprilSamson) - used 15 minutes to learn how to make MD files in Github. The rest of the work hours are used up in updating her OS to Windows 11 Pro. This update should be done outside work hours and it is not paid. So only the 15 minutes spent on learning are paid.
