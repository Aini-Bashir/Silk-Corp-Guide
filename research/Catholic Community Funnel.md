# Catholic community Funnel docummentation 
This milestone aims to create a comprehensive support funnel for Catholic individuals from international communities, particularly from the Philippines, in collaboration with local Catholic churches in the Mid-Ohio Valley region, including Parkersburg and Ravenswood.




The project is rooted in the need for a case management system for homeless individuals in Parkersburg, a requirement set forth by SILK Corp for housing these individuals. Currently, Catholic Charities, an organization with access to this homeless population, lacks a case manager.




The proposed solution is to leverage the skills of our international Catholic community members, who can serve as case managers overseeing the properties and managing the individuals housed in these properties. These individuals will also be responsible for property maintenance tasks such as roofing and painting, thus creating a mutually beneficial arrangement.




Support from local Catholic churches will be sought in the form of a letter of confidence or a similar document endorsing the plan. The case managers may also facilitate events in these SILK Homes owned by SILK Corp, further fostering community engagement.




Upon approval of the funnel, which will be initially presented in a PowerPoint format, an E-2 Franchise document will be prepared for submission to the USCIS.




This milestone is a significant step towards our goal of providing housing solutions for the homeless while also creating opportunities for international Catholic community members to contribute meaningfully to the local community.


For this version, we are putting up a funnel for Catholics but the next versions can be used by any organization. The SILK homes are just a space for any organization to use. They can do fund-raising activities through these homes and a case/property manager from SILK Corp can work with these organizations to help facilitate their events/activities in the SILK Homes. The SILK Homes can get a percentage from the funds raised from these events. These funds can be used to hire local talents for the YACHT Services (Yoga, Arts, Cafe, Home, Tech). This is how SILK Corp empowers the community.
